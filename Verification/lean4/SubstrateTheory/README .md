# Lean 4 Verification

## Core Thesis

Physical constants emerge from Kolmogorov complexity relationships between an ontologically minimal substrate ${(K(Substrate) = 0)}$ and presentations. Energy-complexity correspondence ${(E = κK)}$ unifies quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and cosmology through information-theoretic grounding relations.

## Structure

### Core (Axioms, Types, Parameters, MasterTheorem, Grounding)

Seven substrate axioms:
- K2: Substrate minimality (K(Ω) = 0)
- G1: Universal grounding (all presentations ground to substrate via conditional complexity)
- T7: Time arrow (complexity monotonicity in temporal sequences)
- T4: Emergence collapse (classical emerges from quantum via complexity inversion)
- C6: Coherence preservation (quantum states maintain temporal symmetry)
- Decoherence axioms (irreversible coherence loss)
- Ultimate grounding (transitive grounding paths from substrate)

Master theorem derives energy from complexity, entropy from complexity, establishes holographic bound, uncertainty principle from complexity dynamics.

### Bridge (Convergence, Extended)

Eight convergence theorems connecting ideal K (Kolmogorov complexity) to operational C (computable approximations at precision p):
- BRIDGE1: Point convergence (∀ε>0 ∃p₀: |C(e,p) - K(e)| < ε)
- BRIDGE2: Uniform convergence over finite sets
- BRIDGE3: Partition function convergence (Z_op → Z_ideal)
- BRIDGE4: Grounding relation preservation
- BRIDGE5: Ranking preservation
- BRIDGE6: Coherence measure convergence
- BRIDGE7: Conditional complexity convergence
- BRIDGE8: Temporal derivative convergence

### Operational (Complexity, KLZ)

Computable complexity measures:
- C: Precision-dependent operational complexity
- K_LZ: Lempel-Ziv compression as substrate complexity proxy
- Quantum/classical threshold: is_quantum ≡ K_LZ(join(nbhd)) ≤ c_grounding
- Subadditivity, monotonicity axioms for LZ complexity

### Error (Bounds, Convergence, Composition)

Convergence rate bounds, error composition theorems, precision requirements for bridge theorems.

### CA (Computational Approximation)

Mechanistic proofs, RG1 preservation theorems, time arrow computational validation.

## Methodology

Dual-layer architecture:
1. Ideal theory: Axiomatic K (uncomputably precise Kolmogorov complexity) establishes physics predictions
2. Operational theory: Computable C converges to K as precision increases, enabling empirical validation
3. Bridge theorems: Formal proofs all ideal predictions survive transition to operational regime

Grounding via conditional complexity: e grounds e' iff K(e'|e) < K(e') - K(e) + c_grounding. Provides information-theoretic foundation replacing spacetime manifolds.

## Technical Details

Dependencies: Mathlib (Data.Real.Basic, Analysis.Calculus, SpecialFunctions.Log, Data.Finset)

Real arithmetic: All complexity measures are Real-valued. Planck units constructed from fundamental constants with positivity proofs.

Proof strategy: Axiomatic foundation plus constructive theorems. Physics predictions are axioms (empirically validated elsewhere), mathematical structure is proven. Bridge convergence axioms assert computability without constructive algorithms.

Entity type: Opaque with substrate constant Ω ≡ Substrate. Presentations classified temporal/static, quantum/classical via complexity thresholds.

## Key Theorems

- energy_from_complexity: Mass-energy derived from presentation complexity
- joint_le_sum: Information compression theorem (K_joint ≤ K_sum)
- compression_ratio_ge_one: Lower bound on multi-entity information compression
- R_G1_preserves_grounding: Operational mode operation preserves grounding relations
- generation_set_has_three_elements: Exactly three fermion generations from complexity ranking
